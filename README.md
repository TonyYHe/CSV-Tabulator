# CSV-Tabulator
This program can read in CSV files with all numeric data, and carry out a series of operations on the stored data, including generating reports, graphing it, and sorting it. The project is based on COMP10002 2020 semester 2 assignment 1.

## 'a' command:
- provides the maximum, minimum, average values of the selected columns, also includes the median value if the selected column is sorted.
## 'd' command:
- print out values from the specified columns in their current orderings, and indicating how many consecutive rows have those values.
## 's' command:
- this command sorts the CSV matrix according to the specified columns.
## 'p' command:
- creates a frequency histogram of all data in the selected columns as a "sideways" bar chart.
